Designed as a self-initiated project to bridge the gap between academic theory and practical networking, this infrastructure demonstrates my ability to apply core concepts learned during training into a complex, production-ready campus environment.

✅ This project features a centralized administrative hub controlling four distinct academic branches—Engineering, Arts & Science, Architecture, and Legal Education—each equipped with its own sub-admin office and dedicated departmental servers to manage library and Dean's office data.

✅ I implemented Subnetting for IP efficiency, EIGRP for dynamic routing, VLANs and Inter-VLAN Routing for departmental isolation, EtherChannel for link redundancy, and DHCP for automated device addressing.

✅ These concepts are utilized to ensure seamless communication between the Principal’s room, reception, and meeting halls while maintaining a secure, centralized database for college web pages and staff/student records at the Main Admin level.

✅ The architecture is built using multiple Cisco Routers and Switches, high-performance Servers for web and data hosting, and a variety of end-devices including PCs, Laptops, Printers, and IP Phones.

✅ As a newcomer to the field, I independently designed this topology to validate my understanding of hierarchical network design and to showcase my technical readiness for entry-level networking roles.

I am currently expanding this project to incorporate advanced security and connectivity features, including NAT (Network Address Translation) for internet access and VPN (Virtual Private Network) for secure remote management.
